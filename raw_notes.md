# Raw Notes

*(This is to keep `README.md` clean)*

- Project choices are pretty opinionated
- “Pragmatic Learning” covers the technical skills that make you immediatly productive, that let you ship a working/useful code, serving a specific need, no matter how simple/basic it is.
- At the end of each stage of the “Pragmatic Learning” program, we should get a working software prototype with reusable code. That would serve as a technical building block for larger projects.
- Ideally, we should be building and enhancing one final software product, as we go through the “Pragmatic Learning” program.
- It wasn't actually intentional, but now that I've noticed it, I'm glad that this project somehow embraces the "continuous delivery" approach..
- How to make your web app work offline - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22517162
- The goal is basically to create a set of reusable code snippets.
